# Bloccer
A boxing Arcade game. Kick your enemy into his own goal to win.

## What you need

The Game only has a 2P-Multiplayer. You will need at least 1 Controller to play. 
I recommend to use 2 Controllers, because Bloccer is optimized for it.

Currently, Bloccer is available for Windows as a [Download](https://github.com/derjungeinhd/bloccer/releases/) and playable in the Browser on [itch.io](https://derjungeinhd.itch.io/bloccer)

**NOTE: There is no English translation for Bloccer yet.**

## How to Play

Your goal is to kick your enemy into his own goal.
You get 2 points if your enemy falls into his goal. If you fall into the enemys goal, you lose 1 point.
Same works for your enemy.

Depending on the gamemode, you play to a specific amount of points or till a timer ends.

You can view the controls in the Settings under "Steuerung".

## Compiling
